# Scientific Calculator

A simple scientific calculator implemented in Python using the SymPy library. This calculator allows you to perform basic mathematical operations, as well as some advanced functions and calculations. It provides both symbolic and numerical evaluation of mathematical expressions.

## Features

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Sine (`sin`)
- Cosine (`cos`)
- Tangent (`tan`)
- Arcsine (`asin`)
- Arccosine (`acos`)
- Arctangent (`atan`)
- Exponentiation (`exp`)
- Square Root (`sqrt`)
- Power (`^`)
- Natural Logarithm (`ln`)
- Base-10 Logarithm (`log10`)

## Usage

1. Run the calculator by executing the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The calculator interface will be displayed with a grid of buttons representing different operations.

3. Enter a mathematical expression or type 'quit' to exit the calculator.

4. The calculator will evaluate the expression and display the result.

## Example Usage

- Addition: `2 + 3` returns `5`
- Trigonometric Function: `sin(30)` returns `0.5`
- Exponentiation: `2 ^ 3` returns `8`
- Square Root: `sqrt(16)` returns `4`

## Note

- This calculator uses the SymPy library to handle symbolic expressions and provide accurate numerical results.
- Complex numbers are also supported, and they are displayed as strings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SymPy library (`pip install sympy`)
